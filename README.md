<h1>Anti-ratio bot</h1>

<h2>Why was it made?</h2>
This bot was created for a hack-a-thon run by students at the University of Guelph, where the goal was to create a discord bot that could be implemented in the Guelph Bachelor of Computer Science server. It was a very simple, short entry that I still had a lot of fun making and showing off to people in the server.

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
The purpose of this bot is to prevent to prevent people from "ratio"ing, which is an inside joke in the server where someone says something along the lines of "This" or "Ratio", then proceeds to upvote or downvote themselves with reactions in hopes of getting more reactions. The joke originates from people getting "ratio'd" on twitter, where they get more comments then likes on one of their posts.
The way you use the bot to prevent this, is you apply a role to any user you want to silence with a "Muzzle of Shame" role. Once they have this role, any message they send that contains words (or variants of) "this" and "ratio" will be tracked. When someone reacts to a tracked message with an upvote or downvote, the message will be deleted. Getting rid of any annoying ratios.
